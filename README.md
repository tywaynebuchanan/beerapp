# Beerapp

This beer app allows users to browse and search for different types of beers. The app has a home page where users can see featured beers, and they can also search for beers by name, type, and brewery. Each beer has its own page with details about its taste, alcohol content, and other information. Users can also create an account and save their favorite beers for easy access. The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is fully responsive, meaning it works well on desktop and mobile devices. It gets data from beer API.
